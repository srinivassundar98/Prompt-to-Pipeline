As we dive deeper into the dataset, several key themes emerge. First, the distribution of industries in New Zealand reveals a diverse range of sectors, with some showing more significant representation than others (Chart 013125). This is further supported by Chart 013133, which highlights the frequency and distribution of different industries across the dataset.

Further analysis suggests that there may be varying trends or patterns across different sectors. For instance, Chart 013145 reveals a correlation between two variables, with colors representing different industries, indicating potential sector-specific relationships. Similarly, Chart 013150 shows how different industries have evolved over time, revealing distinct patterns and trends.

The relationship between year and industry code (Chart 013209) suggests that there may be trends or patterns in the data across industries and time periods. This is further supported by Chart 013214, which reveals a visual representation of the relationship between YEAR and VALUE_ID, showcasing the distribution of value IDs across different years.

In terms of industry-level analysis, Charts 013308 and 013320 provide insight into the differences and similarities between various sectors. The box plots in these charts reveal the distribution and comparison of values across different industries, providing valuable information about the magnitude of these differences.

Finally, Chart 013339 provides a high-level overview of the underlying structure and relationships within the data, using principal component analysis to identify the most important factors driving the data.

Overall, our analysis suggests that there are distinct patterns and trends across different industries in New Zealand, with some sectors showing more significant representation than others. By examining these patterns and relationships, we can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and dynamics of the dataset.
