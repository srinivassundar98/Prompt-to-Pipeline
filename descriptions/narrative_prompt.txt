You are a data storyteller. You have the following chart summaries:
- **013125 Idea Analyze the distribution **: This chart reveals the distribution of counts across various industries (INDUSTRY_NAME_NZSIOC_ID) in New Zealand, with each bar representing the number of observations for that industry (INDUSTRY_AGGREGATION_NZSIOC_ID).
- **013133 Idea Create a bar chart showin**: This bar chart shows the count of industries in New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (NZSIOC) by their corresponding codes, providing an overview of the distribution and frequency of different industries across the dataset.
- **013145 Idea Run a correlation analysi**: This chart appears to be a scatter plot showing the relationship between two variables, with colors representing different industries, suggesting that there may be varying trends or patterns across different sectors.
- **013150 Idea Use clustering algorithms**: This chart appears to be a scatter plot showing the relationship between two variables, with different industries represented by distinct colors and sized according to some value, potentially revealing patterns or trends in how these industries have evolved over time.
- **013209 Idea Create a heat map or scat**: This chart appears to be a scatter plot showing the relationship between year and industry code (ANZSIC06 ID) with varying marker colors representing different values, suggesting that there may be trends or patterns in the data across industries and time periods.
- **013214 Idea Run a regression analysis**: This scatterplot reveals a visual representation of the relationship between YEAR and VALUE_ID, showcasing the distribution of value IDs across different years, with each point representing a unique combination of these two variables.
- **013219 Idea Use decision trees or ran**: This chart reveals that the value of `VALUE_ID` varies across different industries (`INDUSTRY_NAME_NZSIOC_ID`) over time, with some industries showing consistent growth or decline while others exhibit more erratic patterns.
- **013308 Idea Run a t test or ANOVA to **: This box plot reveals the distribution and comparison of values across different industries, as represented by the INDUSTRY_CODE_ANZSIC06_ID, with the VALUE_ID providing insight into the magnitude of these differences.
- **013320 Idea Use survival analysis tec**: This survival analysis plot shows how different industries, represented by their ANZSIC06 codes, vary in terms of the maximum year they were active or relevant, with longer-lived industries appearing at higher values on the y-axis.
- **013334 Idea Create a box plot showing**: This box plot reveals the distribution and variability of VALUE_ID values across different VARIABLE_CATEGORY_ID categories, providing insight into the range, median, and outliers within each category.
- **013339 Idea Run a principal component**: This chart reveals the principal components of an idea, showcasing how the two most important underlying factors (0 and 1) relate to each other, providing insight into the underlying structure and relationships within the data.
