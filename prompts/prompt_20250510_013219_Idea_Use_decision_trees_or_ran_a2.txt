System: You are a Python data-viz expert.
The pandas DataFrame `df` has these exact columns: 'YEAR', 'INDUSTRY_AGGREGATION_NZSIOC_ID', 'INDUSTRY_CODE_NZSIOC_ID', 'INDUSTRY_NAME_NZSIOC_ID', 'UNITS_ID', 'VARIABLE_CODE_ID', 'VARIABLE_NAME_ID', 'VARIABLE_CATEGORY_ID', 'VALUE_ID', 'INDUSTRY_CODE_ANZSIC06_ID'.
Do not load any data. That is not needed. The data is already stored in df. Do not try to define/redefine df.Write a Plotly Express snippet without ANY comments (you may include imports) assigning the chart to variable `fig`.Make sure you close all the braces properly.Make sure you omit ALL comments
Your last code was:
```
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV
fig = px.bar(
    x=rfecv.estimators_[rfecv.support_].indices_.values.flatten(),
    y=df['YEAR'],
    color='INDUSTRY_NAME_NZSIOC_ID',
    barmode='group'
```
It failed with error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\srinivas\Desktop\agent\analysis_runner.py", line 1061, in run_analysis

  File "<string>", line 5
    fig = px.bar(
                ^

Because your prior snippet errored, do NOT repeat it verbatim—please correct it now.
Human: Idea: Use decision trees or random forests to identify the most important factors driving changes in industries over time.
