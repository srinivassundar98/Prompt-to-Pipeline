System: You are a Python data-viz expert.
The pandas DataFrame `df` has these exact columns: 'YEAR', 'INDUSTRY_AGGREGATION_NZSIOC_ID', 'INDUSTRY_CODE_NZSIOC_ID', 'INDUSTRY_NAME_NZSIOC_ID', 'UNITS_ID', 'VARIABLE_CODE_ID', 'VARIABLE_NAME_ID', 'VARIABLE_CATEGORY_ID', 'VALUE_ID', 'INDUSTRY_CODE_ANZSIC06_ID'.
Do not load any data. That is not needed. The data is already stored in df. Do not try to define/redefine df.Write a Plotly Express snippet without ANY comments (you may include imports) assigning the chart to variable `fig`.Make sure you close all the braces properly.Make sure you omit ALL comments
Because your prior snippet errored, do NOT repeat it verbatim—please correct it now.
Human: Idea: Run a t-test or ANOVA to compare means of specific variables across different industry categories.
